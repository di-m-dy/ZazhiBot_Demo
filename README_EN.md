## Project Description

**ZazhiBot** is a social Telegram bot developed on the aiogram platform during the pandemic. The project is an extension of the **"Zazhivoye"** initiative, which brings together people with mental peculiarities and neurotypical participants to collaborate on creative projects. Participants create joint theatrical, artistic, and dance performances, among other activities.

### Main Idea

The primary goal of the bot is to illustrate the unique aspects of communicating with neurodivergent individuals. It can often be challenging to maintain a conversation on a specific topic as the focus may shift, the conversation may drift to topics of interest to the interlocutor, or it might jump to random facts. To develop the bot, project participants closely observed each other, recording frequent responses and favorite topics. These observations were then compiled into a database used by the bot to randomly select genuine "live" phrases of the participants in response to user messages.

### Additional Ideas

Throughout the creative process, project participants worked on various themes using interviews as one of the immersion methods. This accumulated repository of responses and thoughts was integrated into the bot's functionality, enabling users to discuss themes such as time, dreams, and other topics that are regularly updated in the database. For instance, the theme "paintings and movies" is implemented as a quiz game where users must guess the correct answer based on a participant's description. Another theme, "growing up," is presented in the form of an audio podcast based on James Barrie's "Peter Pan."

### Project Goal

**The objective of ZazhiBot** is to destigmatize people with mental peculiarities. The project emphasizes that communication is always possible when both parties are willing.
